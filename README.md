## Code snippet

```julia
using TumorGrowth, Lux, Random

times = [0.1, 6.0, 12.0, 18.0, 25.0, 30.0, 35.0, 41.0, 47.0]
volumes = [0.013, 0.0072, 0.0043, 0.0021, 0.0043, 0.0043, 0.0044, 0.0058, 0.015]

# define an experimental model based on a neural ODE:
network = Lux.Chain(Dense(2, 3, Lux.tanh; init_weight=Lux.zeros64), Dense(3, 2))
neural_model = neural2(Random.default_rng(), network)

# compare with with some classical models:
models = [neural_model, logistic, bertalanffy]

julia> comparison = compare(times, volumes, models, holdouts=2)
ModelComparison with 2 holdouts:
  metric: mae
  neural2 (19 params):  0.002656
  logistic:     0.00651
  bertalanffy:  0.006542

using Plots

julia> plot(comparison)
```
